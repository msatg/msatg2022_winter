# Mid-South Algebraic Topology and Geometry Workshop


## About

The first Mid-South Algebraic Topology and Geometry Workshop (华中南代数拓扑几何研讨会) is Online from July 18 to July 20th, 2022.

The algebraic topology and algebraic geometry in China are still developing, especially in the mid-south area. We hope we can help developing the math areas as much as we can. 
We plan to organize a 1-2 days workshop every quarter and a 3-5 days worshop every year in these areas. We also have online joint undergraduate seminars in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.

If you are interested in giving a talk in one of the MSATG workshops, or you would like to give us some comments, feel free to contact us.
